# swiftbar
I couldn't find a progress bar package, so I created one

### Usage
This module is (yet) rather... simple. I. e. create a bar with the length of ```your_collection.count```, loop through ```your_collection``` and update with ```bar.setPrgress(bar.getProgress()++)```. Just have a look at the Examples :)
